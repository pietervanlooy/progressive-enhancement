      <h2>The story</h2>

      <blockquote>
      <b>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,</b>

      <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>

      The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em></q>.


      The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,

      <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>

      farmer again said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>


      The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
      <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too <strong class="bad">bad</strong>,</q>
      and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>
       The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,

       <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q>

       Again, he said,
       <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>

      The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <strong class="good">good</strong> or <strong class="bad">bad</strong> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <strong class="good">good</strong> fortune.

  <p>  <strong>good</strong> and <strong>bad</strong> are just one perspective. Bananas are <strong>good</strong> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <strong>good</strong> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
